# SmartORM

SmartORM is a Java ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that enables you to automatically generate CRUD (Create,
Read, Update, Delete) code at compile time using GPT.With SmartORM, you can simply write DAO (
Data Access Object) interfaces and get complete CRUD operations implemented automatically, while remaining compatible
with the JPA (Java Persistence API) specification.

## Features

- Supports multiple database types, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.
